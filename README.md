# puzzle 2048 is an easy and fun puzzle game. It is played on a 4x4 grid. when slide, tiles with the same value that bump into one-another are merged.

2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the
board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they
are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide
while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The
resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a
soft glow.
If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles
farthest along the direction of motion will combine. If all four spaces in a row or column are filled

with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and
last two.
